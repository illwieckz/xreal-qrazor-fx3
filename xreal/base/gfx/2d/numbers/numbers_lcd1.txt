Description: My first attempt at making hud number replacements.  They're just what the
             title says, LCD numbers.
Installation: Put pak1.pk3 in q3test/demoq3 or quake3/baseq3 or whatever you have your
              directories named...  If pak1.pk3 exists already, rename it to pak2.pk3, 
              and if that exists already, rename it to pak3.pk3, etc.  If you're using
              it in a mod, you can extract it and/or put it in another .pk3 file.
Legal Crap: You're free to redistribute these or use them in a mod or whatever, as long
            as there's no money involved.
